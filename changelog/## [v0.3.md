## [v0.3.0] – Document Viewer and Inbox UI Alignment

### ✨ New Features

- **Paginated Document Viewer**  
  Added realistic multi-page rendering with scroll snapping, line spacing, and zoom controls. Pages are split based on word count to ensure proportional layout.

- **Highlight & Match Card Sync**  
  Implemented interactive linking between highlights and match cards. Cards scroll into view, expand with animation, and support carousel navigation between matches.

- **Match Card Controls**  
  Added functionality to exclude/re-include individual matches, display match counts, and color-code cards to match highlights.

- **Floating Document Controls**  
  Introduced a persistent bottom-left control panel with zoom in/out/reset, current page tracking, and total word count.

- **Font Toggle**  
  Users can now toggle between serif and sans-serif fonts, with preference stored locally.

- **Header and Tab Design**  
  Simulated the iThenticate header bar with document metadata and top-level tabs for future functionality.

### 📁 Inbox UI Redesign

- **Sidebar Navigation**  
  Collapsible sidebar with animated icon-only mode, styled to match the real product.

- **Table Layout Overhaul**  
  Full-width document/folder list with styled rows, select-all checkbox, hover underline affordances, and row-level action menus.

- **Breadcrumb Bar**  
  Extracted breadcrumbs into a visually distinct header row with appropriate spacing and background color.

- **Overall Visual Parity**  
  Matched layout structure, spacing, typography, and iconography to the current production iThenticate UI.
