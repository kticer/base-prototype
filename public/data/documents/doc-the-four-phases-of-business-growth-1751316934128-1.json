Each is vital to the ultimate success of the business. Stage one of the four phases of growth for a business . During this stage, the entrepreneur assumes all or most of the duties necessary to facilitate day-to-day operations “such as marketing, production or service delivery, acconting, credit, and collections (Flamholtz & Randle, 2012, p. 1). Essentially, production happens by any means necessary and there is little to no formal structure to the business. While there are still growing pains to be soothed, phase two is a a little more structured than the first. This is when the incorporation of more workers into the organization allows the owner for assume more “managerial duties such as hiring, scheduling, supervising, and payroll” (McCubbrey, 2009, p. 79) while continuing to facilitate day-to-day operations as an employee. Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business."

The propretor is personally taxed on all income from the business. Stage thre, undoubtedly, a milestone for any business. The inclusion of managers not only enhances the organizational structure, but allows the owner to operate more as a CEO and less as an employee, or manager. Managers work directly with employees and serve as the “middle men/women” between the owner and the workers. In this advanced phase, or phase four, the business is departmentalized and managers exist in each department and at each level. “Job descriptions are clearly defined and employee systems are standardized. The company adopts written policies, budgets, organizational charts, and control protocols” (McCubbrey, 2009, p. 79) at this stage. Reference List Flamholtz, E. G., & Randle, Y. (2012).
