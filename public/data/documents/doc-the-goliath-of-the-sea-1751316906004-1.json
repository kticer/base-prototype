      "content": "The majestic blue whale, the goliath of the sea, certainly stands alone within the animal kingdom for its adaptations beyond its massive size. At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 190 tonnes (210 short tons) or more in weight, it is the largest existing animal and the heaviest that has ever existed. Despite their incomparable mass, aggressive hunting in the 1900s by whalers seeking whale oil drove them to the brink of extinction. But there are other reasons for why they are now so endangered. “The blue whale’s common name derives from bluish-hue that covers the upper side of it body, while its Latin designation is Balaenoptera musculus.” (Smith, 2009, p. 79) The blue whale belongs to the Mysteceti suborder of cetaceans, also known as baleen whales, which means they have fringed plates of fingernail-like material, called baleen, attached to their upper jaws. Blue whales feed almost exclusively on krill, though they also take small numbers of copepods. An adult blue whale can eat up to 40 million krill in a day. These gargantuan beasts used to dominate all the oceans of the Earth up until the late nineteenth century, when the technology was developed to effectively hunt and harvest them. “In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with"

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Very large, aquatic, marine mammals (order Cetacea) that have a torpedo-shaped body with a thick layer of blubber, paddle-shaped forelimbs but no hind limbs, a horizontally flattened tail, and nostrils that open externally at the top of the head (Whales. 2015) Reference List Whales.
